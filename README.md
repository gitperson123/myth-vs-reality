<h3> But thats not true. I've Heared alot of people saying: <q>You Code? Wow, you must be very smart!</q> <br> or <br> <q>You Code? What Are You Going To Hack Next?</q> <br> <br> But Thats Not How It Is <br> While coding is not for everyone, you don't have to bes super smart to code and not all of us are hackers (while they are cool) <br> So I decided to create a Youtube Video. A Youtube Video That shows the <b> <i> DIFFERENCE </i> </b> between the steriotypes of the world and the truth </h3>
